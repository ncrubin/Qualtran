    "# Hamming weight phasing using addition circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we describe how to use the Adder primitive to compute the Hamming weight of a bitstring into a register. To understand how this works we first describe the adder primitive MAJ and UMA followed by how to use the adder primitives to compute Hamming weight. \n",

    "A full adder takes two input bits ($a$ and $b$) and an input carry bit ($c$) and outputs the sum of ($a$ + $b$ + $c$) as a sum bit $s$ and a carry bit $c_{+1}$.  This is the same type of addition that happens in base 10 but instead of carrying on 10 we carry on 2. In a reversible setting we use the input carry bit to store $c \\oplus a$, the $b$ bit stores $a \\oplus b$, and the $a$ bit stores the ouput carry bit $c_{+1}$. This is the ordering used in [A new quantum ripple-carry addition circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410184) in the definition of the $\\mathrm{MAJ}(a, b, c)$ gate.  The $\\mathrm{UMA}$ gate uncomputes the XOR operations and writes the $a$ bit back to the $a$ register, overwrites the $b$ register with the sum of $a \\oplus b \\oplus c$, and restores the original carry bit $c$.  Using these two primitives one can construct the full ripple carry adder for two $n$-bit numbers by $n$ calls to $\\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $n$ calls to $\\mathrm{UMA}$. One also uses an additional ancilla bit to store the final carry bit (copied via a CNOT) before uncomputing with $n$ $\\mathrm{UMA}$. Here are links to the [$\\mathrm{MAJ}$](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[%22X%22,1,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22]],%22init%22:[0,0]}) and [$\\mathrm{UMA}$](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,%22X%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22],[1,%22X%22],[%22X%22,1,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22]]}) circuit as a quirk circuit. Using a logical-AND along with an additional ancilla Craig reduced the Toffoli gate count by 1 for an equivalent $\\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\\mathrm{UMA}$ [(quirk circuit)](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22,%22X%22],[1,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,1,1,%22X%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,1,1,%22X%22],[1,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,1,%22X%22],[1,%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22]]}) and the T-gates by half using the fact that the when a pair of Toffoli are used to compute and uncompute a state one can reduce the number of T gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Craig's adder circuit operates slightly differently to the $\\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\\mathrm{UMA}$ primtives. The first part of the circuit primtive takes as input $a,b,c$ as before and computes the carry bit into the ancilla of the logical-AND. The input bits $a$ and $b$ now store their respective $a \\oplus c$ and $b \\oplus c$. The input carry bit does not change. You can confirm the ouput using [this](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22,%22X%22],[1,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,1,1,%22X%22]],%22init%22:[0]}) quirk circuit.  The second half of the circuit uncomputes the carry bit and computes the sum and uncomputes the $a \\oplus c$ and $b \\oplus c$. The $b$ register is overwritten with the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our Hamming weight circuit we will need a slight modification to the adder where using four bits we compute the sum and carry of $a + b + c$.  This circuit requires a single Toffoli from the logical-AND and zero Toffoli to uncompute. The circuit for the out-of-place adder can be found [here](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22,%22X%22],[1,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22,1,%22X%22],[1,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22]]}) which corresponds to figure 4b of [Halving the cost of quantum addition](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-06-18-74/).  Reading this circuit from top to bottom has inputs $a,b,c,0$ and ouputs $a,b,(a+b+c),(a+b+c)_{1}$ where the $1$ subscript on the last qubit denotes it is the carry bit from the sum.\n",

    "Our goal is to compute the Hamming weight into a register and use the binary-to-unary representation of integers to reduce the number of rotations needed to apply $R_{z}(\\theta)$ to $n$ qubits.  As is stated in [Improved Fault-Tolerant Quantum Simulation of Condensed-Phase Correlated Electrons via Trotterization](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-07-16-296/) page 18, ``We begin with $n$ qubits to which a rotation Rz(Î¸) must be applied. We call these initial qubits 'weight-1' qubits: our goal is to combine them such that we are left with one qubit which captures each digit of the Hamming weight, i.e., one qubit each of weight $1, 2, 4, 8, . . ., 2^{\\lfloor \\log2(n) \\rfloor}$''--or in other words, $|k\\rangle \\rightarrow |w(k)\\rangle$ where $w(k)$ is the binary representation of the Hamming weight of $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how this circuit works we first point out that the out-of-place adder by Gidney converts three bits into a binary representation of the sum of those three bits. Recall the adder works by converting $a,b,c,0$ and ouputs $a,b,(a+b+c),(a+b+c)_{1}$. The last two bits $(a+b+c), (a+b+c)_{1}$ are the binary representation of the Hamming weight for the input of the three bits $w(|a,b,c\\rangle) = 2^{0}(a+b+c)_{0} + 2^{1}(a+b+c)_{1}$.  The next point to understand is that in this construction for computing the Hamming weight we view each digit (qubit) as binary $2^{0}b_{i}$. Thus $|k\\rangle$ can be thought of as $2^{0}k_{0} + 2^{0}k_{1} + ... + 2^{0}k_{n-1}$. Let's consider a concrete 7-bit state $2^{0}b_{0} +  2^{0}b_{1} + 2^{0}b_{2} + 2^{0}b_{3} + 2^{0}b_{4} + 2^{0}b_{5} + 2^{0}b_{6}$.

    "the final expression on the right is the $2^{0}$ binary component of the Hamming weight.  This worked because all the other qubits are storing the carry bits which would correspond to $2^{1}$ binary components.  We now need to add these together.
